Platinum RNG is notoriously inconsistent because the game seems to advance the RNG randomly.

New research has found a way to make it much more consistent!

## More consistent advances

When the save loads, the game does a lot of extra RNG advances when the current time is after the last save date.

To prevent these extra advances, set your time to the max console date (set your console date to **12/31/2099** on NDS or **12/31/2050** on 3DS) before starting your RNG.

After that, you'll find that the game advances the RNG much more consistently, making it easier to hit your target.
