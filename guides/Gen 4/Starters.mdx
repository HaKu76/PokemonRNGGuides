<Step step={0}>

## Set up

Choose the game you're playing below then continue to the next step.

<Alert showIcon type="info" message="Platinum support is coming soon." />

<Starter4Setup />

</Step>

<Step step={1}>

## Pick a starter

1. Fill out the tool below to find a starter that suits you.
2. If you can't find a starter, increase the min and max delays.

Shiny high IV starters are highly unlikely. Try for a max of 3 perfect IVs instead.

</Step>

<Step step={2}>

## Prepare

1. Set your console date to **<Starter4ConsoleSetDateString format="date" />**.
2. Start setting your console time to **<Starter4ConsoleSetDateString format="time" />**, but don't confirm it just yet.

## Hit your target

1. Simultaneously press `A` to set the console time and start the timer below.
2. Exit the settings on your console and restart your console.
3. When the first timer ends, press `A` to start the game.
4. Get to the screen where you load your save.
5. If you've calibrated at least once and need to flip your delay, go back to the title screen one extra time before loading your save.
6. Immediately press `A` when the second timer to goes off.
7. Button mash to get your starter as fast as possible.

</Step>

<Step step={3}>

## Calibrate

1. Check your Pokemon stats.
2. If it matches your target, congratulations! You RNG'd your starter!
3. If not, type your Pokemon info into the form below and click "Generate".
4. Click "Calibrate" on the starter with the smallest delay offset (should be the first result).
5. If the "Flip Delay" column is checked, you'll need to view the title screen one extra time before loading your save.
6. Try to hit your target again.

In Diamond and Pearl it is possible for the delay to randomly switch from even to odd, or vice versa. When this happens, you'll need to keep trying until you get the target.
